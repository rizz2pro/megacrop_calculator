# megacrop_calculator
Updated version of the Megacrop Calculator by Greenleaf

Added:

- PPM and EC values. Tested by me. could be off +/- 20ppm
- A separate calculator to measure by the Gallon

Fixed: 

- Greenleaf site has incorrect NPK values for P,K and S. 

I couldn't get the math to jibe on one page, so pick one or the other. I may eventually get around to making it work, but whatever.
