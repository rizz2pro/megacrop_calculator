# megacrop_calculator
Updated version of the Megacrop Calculator by Greenleaf

Added:

- PPM and EC values. Tested by me. could be off +/- 20ppm
- A separate calculator to measure by the Gallon
- Another calculator that is based off PPM/EC using a multiplier. This one is for those who mix their nutrients by ratios and aiming for a target EC/PPM. 

Fixed: 

- Greenleaf site has incorrect NPK values for P,K and S.
